# Practical Tasks from Cogrammar-Hyperdev Bootcamp

During my immersive experience with **Cogrammar-Hyperdev** bootcamp, I engaged in a series of hands-on tasks encompassing diverse technical topics:

## Data Types and Control Structures

Exploration of programming language fundamentals, including primitive data types such as *integers*, *floats*, *strings*, and *booleans*, alongside sophisticated control structures like conditional statements (*if*, *else*, *elif*) for robust decision-making.

## Iterative Techniques

In-depth study of iterative methodologies employing advanced loop constructs such as *for* loops and *while* loops for iterative processing over data structures like *lists*, *tuples*, and *dictionaries*, fostering efficient code execution.

## Custom Function Development

Proficiency enhancement in Python through the development of bespoke functions catering to specific computational requirements, encompassing advanced concepts such as parameterization, return types, and lexical scoping.

## File Input/Output Operations

Mastery of file handling mechanisms in Python, encompassing versatile file I/O operations involving multiple modes (*read*, *write*, *append*), facilitating seamless interaction with external data sources and destinations.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming paradigms, leveraging Python classes and objects for encapsulating data and behavior, fostering code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

## Data Wrangling with Pandas

Proficient manipulation of datasets and tabular data structures using the **Pandas** library, empowering advanced data wrangling tasks such as data ingestion, transformation, aggregation, and exploration.

## Advanced Data Visualization

Harnessing advanced visualization libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for crafting expressive and informative visual representations of data, facilitating insightful data exploration and communication.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Utilization of sophisticated data cleaning techniques encompassing data imputation, outlier detection, and feature engineering, ensuring data integrity and quality for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks.

These practical exercises equipped me with advanced technical skills and a robust foundation in data science, empowering me to tackle complex real-world challenges in AI, machine learning, and data analysis domains.
